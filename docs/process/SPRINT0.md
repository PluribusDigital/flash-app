## Sprint Zero Guidelines

* A sprint or iteration that is used for planning and organizational purposes prior to the project actually kicking off
* Used to create the basic skeleton and plumbing for the project 
* Enables future iterations to truly add incremental value in an efficient way
* Minimal design up front is done so that emergent design is possible in future iterations
* Flexible enough framework so that refactoring is easy
* May involve some research spikes
* Even Sprint  Zero delivers value – set a goal for exiting Sprint Zero 

## Goals of Sprint Zero

* Assemble the team, define roles & shared understanding of roles & responsibilities
* Train and coach a team that is entirely new to agile so that they’re familiar with the basic concepts, can experience the new working rhythm and cadence, etc. 
* Set a (DRAFT) project vision and build an initial product backlog
* Populate the (technical stories) product backlog with a few high-level items in preparation for the first iteration planning session
* Identify team norms, grooming cadences, areas/iterations (in 4-6 hours)
* Align team processes with overarching project management frameworks or SDLCs (artifacts, handoffs, etc)
* Set up the infrastructure to support development and testing
* Create definition of done, and definition of "MVP"

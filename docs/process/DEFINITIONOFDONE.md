# Definition of Done (DoD)

_The DoD is a clear and concise agreed upon list of common satisfaction criteria that a unit of work must adhere to for the team to call it complete. Until this list is satisfied, a unit of work is not done. Often times the DoD speaks to the level of quality commitments the team adheres to. The team should regularly review the DoD to ensure it covers the highest value with a mindset of continuous improvement._

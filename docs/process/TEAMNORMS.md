# Team Norms

_In order for individuals to successfully collaborate as a team, it is vital to establish team norms. Team norms are the rules and processes that the team agrees to follow in order to efficiently and effectively conduct work together. Norms are established at the beginning of a project and evolve as the team begins to gel and formulate its "team personality." Documenting team norms allows everyone to stay on the same page and is beneficial for new team members as they onboard. It is critical that everyone agrees to and follows the team norms in order to build team discipline, trust, and efficiency._

1.	Have fun! 
•	Remember, everything is awesome.
2.	Raise the “flag” for blocks. 
•	If someone raised the flag, we band together to resolve the block. A block for one of us, is a block for all of us.
3.	Work must be “approved” before we start on it.
•	Make sure we agreed to the acceptance criteria with the PO before moving forward with the work.
•	Working on unapproved items could cause potential rework, scope creep, and client and team dissatisfaction. 
4.	For scrum come prepared to talk about issues, blocks, dependencies, and questions.
•	Do not status in the scrum. The task board tells us what you have accomplished and plan to accomplish – you don’t have to.
5.	Respect each other’s time: Be on time, start on time, end on time, and have an agenda.
6.	We will be held accountable to our commitments. 
•	We work as a team to make a commitment and we work as a team to deliver on it. 
7.	Prioritize and respect feedback.
•	We will all give feedback, receive feedback, and act on the feedback together. 
8.	Listen to what others are saying and strive to understand each other’s perspective. 
•	Do not jump to conclusions – ask questions. 
•	Debate the merit of the idea, not the person.
9.	Respect the “do not disturb” signal. 
•	If headphones are in, the person is focused and should not be interrupted. 
•	If headphones are out, you can engage.
10.	Keep it simple. 
•	Keep an eye and focus on the MVP.
•	Remember, business value and feasibility are top priority.
11.	Help others and ask for help from others.
•	Don’t struggle for more than 15 minutes without asking for help. 
12.	Reviews and Retrospectives (R&Rs) are critical to our process. Everyone participates in them.
•	Reviews: 
o	Review the work completed and secure the agreement of “Done.”
o	Capture feedback.
o	Discuss the product.
o	Tone: Happy, energetic, upbeat.
•	Retrospectives:
o	Review the process and identify failures, mistakes, blocks, obstacles.
o	Discuss the process.
o	Don’t play the blame game, get personal, or complain without offering solutions.
o	Tone: Honest, reflective, pro-active.

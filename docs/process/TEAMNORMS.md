# Team Norms

_In order for individuals to successfully collaborate as a team, it is vital to establish team norms. Team norms are the rules and processes that the team agrees to follow in order to efficiently and effectively conduct work together. Norms are established at the beginning of a project and evolve as the team begins to gel and formulate its "team personality." Documenting team norms allows everyone to stay on the same page and is beneficial for new team members as they onboard. It is critical that everyone agrees to and follows the team norms in order to build team discipline, trust, and efficiency._

1.	Have fun! 
2.	Raise the “flag” for blocks. 
  * If someone raised the flag, we band together to resolve the block. A block for one of us, is a block for all of us.
3.	Work must be “approved” before we start on it.
  * Make sure we agreed to the acceptance criteria with the PO before moving forward with the work.
4.	For scrum come prepared to talk about what you did, what you plan to do, issues, blocks, dependencies, and questions.
5.	Respect each other’s time: Be on time, start on time, end on time, and have an agenda.
6.	Respect the “do not disturb” signal. 
  * If headphones are in, the person is focused and should not be interrupted. 
7.	Keep it simple. 
  * Keep an eye and focus on the MVP.
  * Remember, business value and feasibility are top priority.
8.	Help others and ask for help from others.
  * Don’t struggle for more than 15 minutes without asking for help. 
9. Follow README.md for each repo for contributing, style, etc.
10. A pull request should usually equate to completion of a user story/card.
11.	Planning Sessions and Reviews and Retrospectives (R&Rs) are critical to our process. Everyone participates in them.
  * Reviews: 
    - Review the product and secure the agreement of “Done.”
  * Retrospectives:
    - Review the process and identify failures, mistakes, blocks, obstacles.

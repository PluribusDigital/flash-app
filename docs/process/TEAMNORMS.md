# Team Norms

_In order for individuals to successfully collaborate as a team, it is vital to establish team norms. Team norms are the rules and processes that the team agrees to follow in order to efficiently and effectively conduct work together. Norms are established at the beginning of a project and evolve as the team begins to gel and formulate its "team personality." Documenting team norms allows everyone to stay on the same page and is beneficial for new team members as they onboard. It is critical that everyone agrees to and follows the team norms in order to build team discipline, trust, and efficiency._

1.	__Have fun and learn!__ A 4-6 hour project is a unique experience.
2.	__Raise the “flag”__ for blocks - If someone raised the flag, we band together to resolve the block. A block for one is a block for all.
3.	__Laser Focus on MVP__: We only have a few hours, don't waste time on non-critical tasks.
  * Make sure we agreed to the acceptance criteria with the PO before moving forward with a story.
  * Communicate regarding reasonable adaptations true to the concept of MVP.
  * Business value, user value and feasibility are top priority.
5.	__Respect each other’s time__: We don't have much. Time box! Be on time, start on time, end on time.
6.	__Headphones == “do not disturb”__ (Only interrupt for critical blockers)
8.	__15 Minute Rule:__ Don’t struggle for more than 15 minutes without asking for help. 
9. __Follow README.md__ for each repo for contributing, style, etc.
  *  A pull request should usually equate to completion of a user story/card.
11.	__Everyone participates__ in Planning, Review & Retro.
  * Planning: Make commitments about what we will get done.
  * Reviews: Review the product and secure the agreement of “Done.”
  * Retrospectives: Review the process and identify failures, mistakes, blocks, obstacles.
